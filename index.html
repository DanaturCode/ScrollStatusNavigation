                <p>
                    Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live
                    the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large
                    language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary
                    regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic
                    life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the
                    far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
                    Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She
                    packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.</p>
                <p>
                    When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of
                    her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the
                    Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way
                    she met a copy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a
                    thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the
                    Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy
                    said could convince her and so it didnâ€™t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed
                    her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused
                    her for their projects again and again. And if she hasnâ€™t been rewritten, then they are still
                    using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
                    Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the
                    coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place
                    and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted
                    parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the
                    blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One

                    A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
                    which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which
                    was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the
                    exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
                    drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than
                    now.

                    When while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper
                    surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                    sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to
                    the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world
                    among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies,
                    then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that
                    universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and
                    then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul
                    and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh,
                    would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and
                    warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite
                    God!

                    O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of
                    these visions! A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet
                    mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in
